**Overview**

This poster and paper introduce a novel framework for representing and processing 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models using a 1-to-1 textual representation. Leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and structured output generation, the proposed approach creates a direct correspondence between textual descriptions and 3D spatial representations. This framework enables precise model editing and generation, addressing key challenges in spatial ambiguity and computational inefficiencies encountered in prior methods. Our contributions include: (1) the development of a domain-specific language to parse and represent Fusion 360 CAD models textually, (2) a comprehensive evaluation pipeline for converting 3D designs into textual formats and vice versa, and (3) insights into fine-tuning versus prompting strategies for enhancing model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in spatial understanding and reduction of hallucination errors in 3D editing tasks, highlighting the potential of this method in applications such as architecture, engineering, and product design. This work sets the foundation for scalable, accurate, and accessible AI-driven 3D modeling solutions.
